1_bit_AM
========

Attempt at a 1 bit oversampling ADC based AM Radio for ULX3S board.

Based on a few projects on the web such as this one featuring [1-bit SDR on MachX02 board](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/building-a-1-bit-oversampling-sdr-with-not-much-more-than-a-low-cost-fpga/) and this one, a [Nexys board AM radio](https://github.com/dawsonjon/FPGA-radio).
